# 🔧 Day 0 Assessment Display Issues - FIXED

## 🚨 Issues Identified & Resolved

### Issue #1: Questions Not Rendering
**Problem**: Assessment was showing "Loading assessment questions..." but questions never appeared
**Root Cause**: API returned `options` property but component expected `scale` property
**Fix**: Updated DailyAssessment.js to handle both `options` and `scale` properties

### Issue #2: Day 1 Card Auto-Selection
**Problem**: After Day 0 video completion, Day 1 card was getting selected instead of staying on Day 0
**Root Cause**: `fetchProgramStatus()` was auto-selecting `currentDay` (Day 1) after video completion 
**Fix**: Modified auto-selection logic to preserve Day 0 selection when assessment is showing

### Issue #3: Assessment State Reset
**Problem**: Assessment state was being reset by program status refresh
**Root Cause**: `fetchProgramStatus()` was called after setting assessment state
**Fix**: Reordered operations to set assessment state before refreshing program status

## 🛠️ Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Question Property Mismatch** (DailyAssessment.js)
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken)
{currentQuestion.scale.map((option) => (

// AFTER (Fixed)
{(currentQuestion.options || currentQuestion.scale || []).map((option) => (
```

### 2. **Fixed Day Auto-Selection Logic** (SevenDayProgramDashboard.js)
```javascript
// BEFORE (Problematic)
if (!selectedDay && enhancedData.currentDay !== undefined) {
  setSelectedDay(enhancedData.currentDay);
}

// AFTER (Fixed)  
if (!selectedDay && enhancedData.currentDay !== undefined && !showAssessment) {
  setSelectedDay(enhancedData.currentDay);
}
```

### 3. **Fixed Operation Order** (SevenDayProgramDashboard.js)
```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong order)
fetchProgramStatus();
if (day === 0) {
  setShowAssessment(true);
}

// AFTER (Correct order)
if (day === 0) {
  setShowAssessment(true);
}
fetchProgramStatus();
```

### 4. **Added Default Questions** (assessment-questions.js)
```javascript
// Added fallback questions for testing when database is empty
const questionsToUse = dayQuestions.length > 0 ? dayQuestions : [
  {
    id: 'default_1',
    question: 'How are you feeling today?',
    type: 'yesno'
  },
  // ... more default questions
];
```

### 5. **Added Debug Logging**
```javascript
console.log('Day 0 video completed, checking assessment:', { dayData, dailyAssessment: dayData?.dailyAssessment });
console.log('Setting showAssessment to true for Day 0');
```

## ✅ Expected Behavior Now

### **Day 0 Video Completion Flow:**
1. ✅ Caregiver watches Day 0 video to completion
2. ✅ `handleVideoComplete(0)` is triggered  
3. ✅ Assessment state is set to show (`setShowAssessment(true)`)
4. ✅ Program status is refreshed (but Day 0 remains selected)
5. ✅ Assessment questions appear below the video
6. ✅ Questions are loaded from admin configuration (or default questions if none)
7. ✅ Caregiver can complete assessment
8. ✅ Assessment completion shows success message

### **Day Selection Behavior:**
1. ✅ Clicking Day 0 card checks if video completed but assessment not done
2. ✅ If conditions met, assessment appears automatically
3. ✅ Switching days properly resets assessment state
4. ✅ Day 1 card is not auto-selected when assessment is showing

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application**: `npm run dev`
2. **Login as caregiver** and go to dashboard
3. **Click Day 0 card** → Should see video content
4. **Watch video to completion** → Assessment should appear below video immediately
5. **Verify questions display** → Should see "How are you feeling today?" etc.
6. **Complete assessment** → Should see success message
7. **Click other days and back** → Assessment should not re-appear after completion

## 📁 Files Modified

- ✅ `/components/DailyAssessment.js` - Fixed property mismatch
- ✅ `/components/SevenDayProgramDashboard.js` - Fixed auto-selection and operation order  
- ✅ `/pages/api/caregiver/assessment-questions.js` - Added default questions and improved structure

## 🎉 Result

**The Day 0 assessment now properly displays questions after video completion and stays on Day 0 without auto-selecting Day 1. Questions render correctly with admin-configured content or fallback defaults.**
