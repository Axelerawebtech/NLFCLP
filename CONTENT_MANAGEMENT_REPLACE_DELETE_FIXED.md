# Content Management Replace/Delete Functionality - FIXED! 📝

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The Content Management section in the admin interface (`http://localhost:3000/admin/program-config` → "📝 Content Management - Days 0-7") now has **complete replace/delete functionality** just like the Video Content Management section.

## 🔍 **What Was Missing**

1. **Delete API Endpoint**: The `/api/admin/delete-content` API was missing
2. **Save Function Issues**: The `saveContentData` function had incorrect API format
3. **Redundant Save Calls**: Upload/delete functions were calling unnecessary saves

## ✅ **Complete Solution Implemented**

### **1. Created Missing Delete API**
**File**: `/pages/api/admin/delete-content.js`

**Features**:
- ✅ Deletes content from database (ProgramConfig collection)
- ✅ Removes files from Cloudinary storage
- ✅ Supports all content types (audioContent, motivation, etc.)
- ✅ Proper error handling and logging
- ✅ Returns detailed deletion status

### **2. Fixed Save Function**
**Before (Broken)**:
```javascript
// Wrong format - sent entire object
body: JSON.stringify({
  day: selectedContentDay,
  contentType: contentType,
  content: contentData[contentType] // ❌ Wrong!
})
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```javascript
// Correct format - individual language saves
for (const language of languages) {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    day: selectedContentDay,
    contentType: contentType,
    language: language,
    url: content // ✅ Correct!
  })
}
```

### **3. Optimized Upload/Delete Flow**
- ✅ Removed redundant `saveContentData()` calls
- ✅ Upload API already saves to database
- ✅ Delete API already removes from database
- ✅ Better error handling with proper user feedback
