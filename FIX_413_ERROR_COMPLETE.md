# 413 Payload Too Large Error - FIXED

## âœ… Root Cause Identified
**Error 413 (Payload Too Large)** occurs when:
- Video file size exceeds Cloudinary's standard upload limit (~100MB)
- File was 213.89MB, which exceeds the standard upload API limit

## ðŸ”§ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Smart Upload Method Selection**
```javascript
// Use chunked upload for files larger than 100MB
if (fileSizeInMB > 100) {
  console.log('ðŸ“¤ Using chunked upload for large file (>100MB)...');
  // Chunked upload with 6MB chunks
  uploadResult = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload_large(filePath, {
      ...uploadOptions,
      chunk_size: 6000000,
    }, callback);
  });
} else {
  // Standard upload for smaller files
  uploadResult = await cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload(filePath, uploadOptions);
}
```

### 2. **Extended Timeouts for Large Files**
- **Large files (>100MB)**: 5-minute timeout
- **Smaller files**: 3-minute timeout
- **Backend**: 3-minute Cloudinary timeout

### 3. **Better Error Messages**
- **413 errors**: Specific message about file size limits
- **Timeout errors**: Different timeouts based on file size
- **Network errors**: Clear connectivity guidance

### 4. **Enhanced Logging**
- File size-based upload method selection
- Detailed chunked upload progress
- Better error diagnostics

## ðŸ“Š File Size Handling
- **Under 100MB**: Fast standard upload
- **100MB - 500MB**: Chunked upload with 6MB chunks
- **Over 500MB**: Rejected with clear error message

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

1. **Navigate to**: http://localhost:3003/admin/program-config
2. **Login**: `admin` / `admin123`
3. **Try uploading your 213MB video file** again
4. **Expected behavior**:
   - âœ… System detects large file and uses chunked upload
   - âœ… Extended 5-minute timeout for large files
   - âœ… Progress indication shows chunked upload
   - âœ… Successful upload with proper URL returned

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results
- âœ… No more 413 errors for large files
- âœ… Chunked upload handling for files >100MB
- âœ… Better progress feedback
- âœ… Clear error messages for different scenarios

**The system should now handle your 213MB video file successfully!**
