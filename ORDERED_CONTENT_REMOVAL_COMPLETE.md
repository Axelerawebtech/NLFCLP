- **`pages/api/caregiver/ordered-content.js`** - Caregiver API for fetching ordered content sequences
- **`pages/api/caregiver/ordered-content-complex.js`** - Complex ordered content delivery logic

### 3. âœ… Database Models Removed
- **`models/Content.js`** - MongoDB schema for ordered content with completion tracking

### 4. âœ… Admin Dashboard Cleanup
**File: `components/ProgramConfigManager.js`**
- Removed entire "ðŸ”¢ Ordered Content Management" section (350+ lines)
- Removed state variables: `selectedOrderedDay`, `selectedOrderedCategory`, `orderedContentList`, etc.
- Removed functions: `loadOrderedContent()`, `createOrderedContent()`, `deleteOrderedContent()`, etc.
- Removed useEffect for ordered content loading
- Kept only original systematic content uploading functionality

### 5. âœ… Caregiver Dashboard Updates

### 6. âœ… Build System Cleanup
- Removed empty test files that were causing build errors
- Verified successful build completion
- No compilation errors or warnings related to removed functionality

## Current State

### âœ… What Still Works (Legacy System)
1. **Original Video Upload System**: Admin can upload videos for Days 0-7 by burden level
2. **Day 0 Core Module**: Video upload and configuration
3. **Day 1 Burden Assessment**: Zarit burden test with video content by severity
4. **Content Management**: Motivation messages, healthcare tips, reminders, daily tasks
5. **Multi-language Support**: English, Kannada, Hindi content management
6. **Wait Time Configuration**: Global wait times between days
7. **Caregiver Dashboard**: Shows content based on burden assessment results
8. **Legacy Video Player**: Works with existing video URLs and content structure

### âœ… Admin Dashboard Features Retained
- Day 0-7 video content upload by language and burden level
- Burden test question configuration
- Quick assessment questions
- Content management for multiple content types
- Global wait time settings
- All original systematic uploading functionality

### âœ… Caregiver Experience

- All existing functionality works as before ordered content was introduced
