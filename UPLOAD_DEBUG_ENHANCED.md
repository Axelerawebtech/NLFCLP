# Upload Fix - Enhanced Debugging

## âœ… Changes Applied

### 1. Simplified Upload Method
- **Removed**: Problematic chunked upload that was returning stream objects
- **Added**: Standard upload with extended 3-minute timeout
- **Benefit**: More reliable upload process

### 2. Enhanced Logging
```javascript
// Connection test
console.log('ðŸ”— Testing Cloudinary connection...');
console.log('ðŸ“‹ Cloudinary config:', {...});

// Upload process
console.log('ðŸ“¤ Starting upload to Cloudinary...');
console.log('ðŸ”§ Upload options:', {...});
console.log('ðŸ“Š Upload result:', {...});
```

### 3. Better Error Handling
- **Added**: Detailed error logging with stack traces
- **Added**: Upload options logging for debugging
- **Added**: Connection verification

## ðŸ§ª Test Instructions

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3003/admin/program-config
2. **Upload a video file** in the "Days 0-7: Video Content" section
3. **Check terminal logs** for detailed debugging information

## Expected Logs
You should now see:
- âœ… Cloudinary connection test
- âœ… Upload options configuration
- âœ… Detailed upload result or specific error messages

The server will now provide much more detailed information about what's happening during the upload process.

**Try uploading again and let me know what the detailed logs show!**
