# Day 1 Comprehensive Flow Implementation

## ✅ **Complete Implementation Done!**

I've implemented the full Day 1 flow with score-based content delivery as requested. Here's what's been created:

### 🎯 **Flow Structure:**

When users click "Continue to Day 1 Content", they enter a 3-step process:

**Step 1: Video → Step 2: Message/Prompt → Step 3: Daily Tasks → Reminder**

## 🔄 **Burden Level Specific Flows:**

### **MILD (Score 0-20):**
```
1. 📹 Play video
2. 💪 Show motivational message: "Your care matters — a small break keeps you stronger."
3. ✅ Daily Yes/No Tasks:
   - "Did you take one 2-minute break today?"
   - "Did you practice deep breathing today?"
4. 🕊️ Daily Reminder: "Take 2 minutes for yourself today — relax and breathe."
5. 💾 Backend: Logs frequency of "Yes" responses daily
```

### **MILD-MODERATE (Score 21-40):**
```
1. 📹 Play 5-min video
2. 💡 Interactive popup: "Now try it! Write your biggest problem and one solution below."
   - Text box entry with example: "Problem: I cannot cook daily. → Solution: Cook once for two meals."
3. 📅 Weekly Check-in:
   - "Have you practiced your problem-solving step this week?"
   - "Did it help?" (Yes/No)
4. 💾 App stores responses for review
5. 💡 Encouraging reminder: "You're doing great! Small steps make a big difference."
```

### **MODERATE-SEVERE (Score 41-60):**
```
Same as mild-moderate with enhanced support
```

### **SEVERE (Score 61-88):**
```
1. 📹 Play video
2. 🎯 Immediate reflection box:
   - "What problem feels hardest right now?"
   - "What solution will you try?"
3. ✅ Daily Tasks:
   - "Did you practice your problem-solving step today?" (Yes/No)
   - "Did you take one 2-minute break today?" (Yes/No)
4. 🚨 Support trigger: If "No" for 3 days → Automatic message:
   "It seems you are having a difficult week. Please call your nurse or Tele-MANAS (14416) for support."
5. 💬 Daily Reminder: "You're doing your best. Take a breath. Small progress counts."
```
