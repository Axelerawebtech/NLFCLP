# Zarit Burden Assessment Recording System

## Overview
The Zarit burden assessment responses, total score, and completion date are now comprehensively recorded in each caregiver's profile, similar to the quick assessment recording system.

## Data Structure

### Location
The assessment data is stored in the `oneTimeAssessments` array within each caregiver's program document in MongoDB.

### Schema
```javascript
oneTimeAssessments: [{
  type: "zarit_burden",
  responses: [
    {
      questionId: "question1",
      questionNumber: 1,
      questionText: "Do you feel that your relative asks for more help than he/she needs?",
      responseValue: 2,           // Score selected (0-4)
      responseText: "Sometimes",  // Text of selected option
      answeredAt: Date
    }
    // ... 21 more responses for complete 22-question assessment
  ],
  totalScore: 44,                // Sum of all response values
  scoreLevel: "moderate",        // Calculated burden level (mild/moderate/severe)
  completedAt: Date,            // When assessment was completed
  language: "english",          // Language used for assessment
  totalQuestions: 22,           // Number of questions answered
  
  // Enhanced statistics
  assessmentDetails: {
    averageScore: 2.0,           // Average score per question
    maxPossibleScore: 88,        // Maximum possible total score
    completionPercentage: 50,    // Percentage of max score achieved
    questionsAnswered: 22,       // Number of questions completed
    retakeNumber: 1              // Track if this is a retake
  },
  
  // Metadata for tracking
  metadata: {
    submissionMethod: "inline_assessment",
    submittedFrom: "caregiver_dashboard",
    deviceInfo: "...",           // Browser user agent
    ipAddress: "..."             // IP address (anonymized)
  }
}]
```
